# earned-autonomy — answer key

`replay.py` proves the **corrected** H6 semantics after the harness-council re-audit caught the first fix as hollow. The first cut armed `verify_gen.fresh_refute`'s generic invariants (`typeof e === 'function'`, `JSON.stringify(e) === JSON.stringify(e)`) as the refuter — but those are **tautologies**: no module that passed its gate can fail them, so `false_pass` was structurally pinned at `0.0` and Tier 2 auto-granted (the prior `record_refuter_check(agreed=True)` fake wearing a `node` subprocess). The eval even "proved" the disagree case only by **hand-overwriting** the sidecar.

The fix: a refuter counts toward `false_pass` (and thus toward Tier 2) **only if it exercises behavior** — invokes an export on an input the gate did not use (`verify_gen.is_behavioral`). The generic floor is demoted to a non-measuring **liveness** check.

| # | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| **H1** | THE HONEST FLOOR. With no behavioral refute set, `produce_refuter` arms the generic floor as `measuring: false`. It AGREES with a loading module — yet `false_pass` stays **`unmeasured`** and the family is capped at **Tier 1**. A tautology cannot earn lights-out autonomy |
| **H2** | A REAL oracle measures. A behavioral refute set (`compute(7,8) === 15` — an input the gate `compute(2,3)===5` never used) makes `produce_refuter` arm a `measuring: true` refuter. A conformant module (`compute = a+b`) agrees → `false_pass` **MEASURED at 0.0** → validated verifier + armed budget ⟹ **Tier 2 EARNED** |
| **H3** | THE CATCH, no smuggling. An OVERFIT module (`compute` special-cased to the gate's exact inputs, `0` elsewhere) genuinely **passes its gate** (`run_validation` advances it — H3a), then the SAME producer-armed behavioral refuter **DISAGREES** (`compute(7,8)=0 ≠ 15` — H3b, no hand-overwrite) → an incident drops the tier below 2 (H3c). This is the false pass the hollow floor of H1 would have waved through |

**The standing consequence:** Tier 2 is now honestly unreachable from the deterministic floor alone — it requires a behavioral refute set authored independently of the gate (operator, or a headless refuter-author — see the backlog). The dev-server consumes that set when present; absent it, the family sits at Tier 1. `unmeasured` is not `0.0`, and a tautology is not a measurement.

Needs `node`; skips with exit 0 if absent. Unit-covered by `verify_gen.py selftest` (`is_behavioral`), `dispatch.py selftest` (`produce_refuter` measuring split), and `ledger.py`/`autonomy.py` selftests (the `unmeasured`/measuring filter).
